# branchNameStrategy option determines how to approach a situation when the
# desired branch of the testplans library repository is not available.
# There are currently following strategies available:
#  * exact-match
#  * drop-least-significant
#
# exact-match
#  This strategy uses the branchNameFormat and doesn't allow fallback to any
#  other branch if the desired one is not available and fails.
#
# drop-least-significant
#  This strategy uses the branchNameFormat and if the desired branch is not
#  available tries another branch names continuously dropping the least
#  significat part of the version specification until branch of such name is
#  found (success) or until there's nothing more to drop (failure).
#  Example of branch names attempts is:
#   Foo-1.2-3 -> Foo-1.2 -> Foo-1 -> Foo -> (failure)
branchNameStrategy=drop-least-significant
# branchNameFormat option defines desired format of the branch that should be
# used when cloning the testplans library repository. Depending on the
# branchNameStrategy either branch of this format (or modified) will be used.
# Jinja2 template is used for branch name formatting where the event as well as
# all event structures are provided as separate variables.
branchNameFormat={{event.product.name.lower()}}-{{event.product.major}}.{{event.product.minor}}
# Determines how test configurations of testplan and testcase are merged
# Possible methods are:
#   intersection - include the CaseRunConfiguration in TestRun only if the configurations in testplan and testcase are identical
#   extension - include the CaseRunConfiguration in TestRun if the testcase configuration doesn't conflict with the one in the testplan and add values from testplan configuration to compatible testcase configurations. If there are multiple compatible testplan configurations, new testcase configurations are created.
