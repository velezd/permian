"""
cli package handles execution of the pipeline from commandline. This package
focuses on parsing of cmdline arguments and executing the pipeline with
desired parameters.

It's possible to extend the CLI in plugins by introducing new commands.
The commands have associated parser function which provides parsed options
and event which the pipeline should react on. For more information see
CliFactory class.
